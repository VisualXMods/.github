# Welcome to visualX

Hello there! Welcome to the visualX profile! Let me explain who we are.

## About visualX
visualX is a modding community for Gorilla Tag, created by the same team behind [AVPTag](https://avptag.github.io).  
We ***ONLY*** create legal mods — illegal mods are not allowed here.

## Developer Guidelines
If you are a developer and want to use our code, you must follow these rules:

- All code usage must comply with the [GPL-3.0 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html). Please read the license carefully.  
- Your operating system does ***NOT*** matter. If a mod breaks on another OS, you may inform your users that it does not work there. However, our code is designed to be cross-platform.  

## What We Expect in Return
Here’s what we ask from anyone using our code:

- Follow both the [AVPTag](https://github.com/AVPTag) and [visualX](https://github.com/AVPTag) GitHub profiles.  
- Subscribe to [@hopefullty](https://youtube.com/@hopefullty) on YouTube.  
- **Do not distribute our mods as direct downloads** (.dll files). Always link back to the GitHub repository to ensure security and trust for your users.  

That’s it! Keep it legal, safe, and fun.
